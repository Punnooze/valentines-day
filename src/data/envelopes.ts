    content: `So, as you know its the first time ive had a girlfriend for valentines day and since you just accepted to be my valentine😋 I wanted to go all out and make something for you. Celebrating valentines day while being this far away is PAINFULLL, butttt Ill be seeing you next weekend😋. So ive been brainstorming and came up with a plan. Other people have rose day chocolate day etc, but we different bro. We make our own days. At least thats the plan. So. Today is “Grateful day”.
    Im so so grateful you are in my life. You came to my life when I least expected it. And neither of us imagined we would be here right now when we matched on hinge almost 7 months ago. From that to now. We have come a LONG way. And im so grateful for it. Everyday I wake up happy knowing you are there for me. And that you are in my life. You are such an amazing person and im lucky to have even met you. Im grateful for everything. Every single gift(Each and every one of them are so special. Even the tissues). All the cars you bought me(best girlfriend ever). The songs you send. The random tea you drop. How you make me feel seen and heard. You make me want to do better. Thank you for being you. 
    Im SO grateful for every wrong turn that led me to you.

I love you and im so happy you are in my life🩷`

    content: `Ah. Theres just so many things that i cant even list down. But ill try mentioning a few. I love how you have your opinions on things and you stick to regardless of who says what. Im so proud of you for it and i respect you for it. I love how strong you are. Well things are not exactly smooth at home. Uve had some bad experiences but you fought through all of them. No one has to go through all this. But you are handling it pretty good and im so proud of you for it. I love how you are ready to listen. Sometimes im just spinning out and im stuck in my head and you are ready to listen. We have fights. And you were ready to hear me out even when i messed up. I love how hard working and genuine you are. If you do something you actually put your heart and soul into it and its such a respectable quality. Again. There are so many more thingsss. 

I love every single thing about you 🩷

We were both so tired the next day, but I wouldn't trade that moment for anything. Those conversations, those laughs, those quiet moments... they're what I hold onto when I miss you.

I can't wait to make a million more memories with you. 🌙✨`

When we're finally together again, I'm not letting you go. Like literally. I'm going to hug you for at least 3 hours straight.

You've been warned. 😂

(But seriously, prepare for the longest hug of your life) 🤗`

🎵 "Can't Help Falling in Love" - Elvis Presley

"Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you..."
