Everything. But especially the way you light up when you talk about things you're passionate about. Your smile could power entire cities.

You're not just beautiful on the outside - your heart, your mind, your soul... everything about you is absolutely stunning.

Never forget how incredible you are. 💕`

We were both so tired the next day, but I wouldn't trade that moment for anything. Those conversations, those laughs, those quiet moments... they're what I hold onto when I miss you.

I can't wait to make a million more memories with you. 🌙✨`

When we're finally together again, I'm not letting you go. Like literally. I'm going to hug you for at least 3 hours straight.

You've been warned. 😂

No matter how far apart we are, no matter how hard it gets, I'm not going anywhere.

Always. 💍`

Until then, know that you have my whole heart. Always and forever.

I love you more than words can say.

Yours, always. ❤️

P.S. - You really are my Valentine, you know. Today and every day. 💘`
