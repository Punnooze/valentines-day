    title: "Grateful day",
    content: `So, as you know its the first time ive had a girlfriend for valentines day and since you just accepted to be my valentine😋 I wanted to go all out and make something for you. Celebrating valentines day while being this far away is PAINFULLL, butttt Ill be seeing you next weekend😋. So ive been brainstorming and came up with a plan. Other people have rose day chocolate day etc, but we different bro. We make our own days. At least thats the plan. So. Today is “Grateful day”.
    Im so so grateful you are in my life. You came to my life when I least expected it. And neither of us imagined we would be here right now when we matched on hinge almost 7 months ago. From that to now. We have come a LONG way. And im so grateful for it. Everyday I wake up happy knowing you are there for me. And that you are in my life. You are such an amazing person and im lucky to have even met you. Im grateful for everything. Every single gift(Each and every one of them are so special. Even the tissues). All the cars you bought me(best girlfriend ever). The songs you send. The random tea you drop. How you make me feel seen and heard. You make me want to do better. Thank you for being you. 
    Im SO grateful for every wrong turn that led me to you.

I love you and im so happy you are in my life🩷`

    title: "What I love about you day ",
    content: `Ah. Theres just so many things that i cant even list down. But ill try mentioning a few. I love how you have your opinions on things and you stick to it regardless of who says what. Im so proud of you for it and i respect you for it. I love how strong you are. Well things are not exactly smooth at home. Uve had some bad experiences but you fought through all of them. No one has to go through all this. But you are handling it so well and im so proud of you for it. I love how you are ready to listen. Sometimes im just spinning out and im stuck in my head and you are ready to listen. We have fights. And you were ready to hear me out even when i messed up. I love how hard working and genuine you are. If you do something you actually put your heart and soul into it and its such a respectable quality. I love how you appreciate the little things. And i love ur taste in fashion and music. Its so good and im glad a bit of it is rubbing off on me. I love everything about you. The person you are. I love you on your bad days.
      Again. There are so many more thingsss. 

I love you on your good days and i love you even more on your bad days. And im not going to stop loving you. 🩷

    title: "A Memory Day",
    content: `There are so many moments that i keep thinking of. Most are funny and make me laugh. Some make me miss you. Some make me feel loved. So i just wanted to pick some of my favourite memories. Our first date is obviously on the list. I was SO nervous. New place. New people. Just to meet a girl I’ve never met before. Someone i cared about deeply. I remember waiting in front of your hostel with a bunch of Lillies in my hand. Sweating SO MUCH. And then i saw you walking down. In bibtya. And man. Uff. Gone. We went to have lunch and i couldn’t stop staring at you. We have been dating for almost 7 months but every single time i see you i am just so amazed. I just want to sit and stare. Last time we met. And we were sleeping. It just felt like home. It just felt right. I can’t explain how good it felt to sleep next to you. Babee. Literally every single memory is so special. Every second with you is so special. That time i asked you to be my girlfriend. Standing outside of polar bear in the midfield of the night. Asking you to be my girlfriend even though we hadn’t even  met each other. God there are so many good memories and i am so glad you are in my life. The thought of you whistling at a rat keeps popping up in my head randomly ahhh its one of my favourite memories in life. So many precious moments. Me buying momos for you. Crying together in airport. Staying up till 4 am doomscrolling and then regretting it the next day but only to do it again. 
    
  I love you and i can’t wait to make more and more memories together. 🩷`
